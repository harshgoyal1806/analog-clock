# ðŸ•’ Analog Clock

A simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases how basic front-end web technologies can be used to create a functional, real-time analog clock with clean visuals and smooth hand movements.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time clock updates
- Animated hour, minute, and second hands
- Minimal and clean design
- Responsive layout


## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **HTML** defines the layout of the clock, including elements for the clock face and the three hands (hour, minute, and second).
- **CSS** is used to style the clock, center elements, and create the rotation origin for the hands.
- **JavaScript** calculates the current time and applies rotation transforms to the hands, updating every second with `setInterval`.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Transforms)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Date API)
